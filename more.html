  <h1>more information</h1>
  <h2>this page has more information attacks and how to avoid them.</h2>
  <p>phishing:</p>
  <p>This attack is one of the more common one that is seen by people all the time, you might even see it. most might know it as junk email or ejunk if your me, as ejunk it is not very bad just annoying, but phishing attacks can be worse. they range from emails from your rich uncle you never knew you had to an important situation or your bank has been hacked. you can tell if it is a fake email by looking for spellign errors, poor quality images, and/or a sense of urgency. some can even infect your computer with a worm, which is a type of virus that can spread itself, and wreak havoc on your device.</p>
  <p>spear phishing:</p>
  <p>this attack is very effictive and was used by hackers to hack target, more on that soon, spear phishing attacks are target phishing attacks on a person or group of people. these attacks are nothing to be messed with because they can and probably will contain a worm or other virus. these are avoided using stratigies mentioned before. now onto the target incedent, What happend was hackers sent a spear phising email to a HVAC contracter working for target. the email contained a worm and because the contracter was in the payment servers of Target the worm was able to harvest credentials of a lot of people before anyone noticed.</p>
  <p>Scareware:</p>
  <p>this attack involves getting a lot of basicly ejunk that of threats and other things to scare you into doing something. to avoid it employ my methood of ingnoring it unless someone directly tells you. also if it links to an external site with a sketchy url then you know it is probably an attack.</p>
  <p>baiting:</p>
  <p>this attack involves things like ads that say "you just won a free car" or any variation of it. they are easily avoided by ingoring the ejunk ads or other thing attempting to bait you to do something.</p>
  <p>pretexting:</p>
  <p>this is when an attack creates fake situations to get you to leak your private information. They might seem scary and like your going to be decieved but all you have to do to avoid it is  ignore it. That is the goto method but even if you recieve disastrous news over email it is probaly false. Most Companys, medical facilities, and other simalar things will call and tell you that news with a live operator not a robot or email, That is considered insensitive.   </p>
  <p>prelimenary trials:</p>
  <p>3 tests were done in the prelims all have failed</p>
